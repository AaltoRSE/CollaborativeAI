# Collaborative AI Arena

The collaborative AI arena is intended to serve as a basis for evaluation of collaboration between AI and Humans. The idea is to design and evaluate tasks which are performed with input from both sides, and figure out if the collaboration was successful.
Users should be presented with a task that they perform together with the AI and metric should be used to evaluate the different

This repository contains most of the code necessary to add a Model or a Task.

## Templates

The `task_template` and `model_template` folders contain template applications for deployment on the AI Builder infrastructure.
They indicate how to implement a model and a task and supply most infrastructure necessary to minimise the requirements of a user to adopt their code.
Details are provided in the respective README files.
